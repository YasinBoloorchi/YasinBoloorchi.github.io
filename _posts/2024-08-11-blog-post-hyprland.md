Recently I was forced to reinstall the operating system on my computer and it gave me the opportunity to look for a new graphical environment. For many years I have been using i3 Window Manager as my primary workstation. Still, I wanted to experience something different so I started browsing the Internet in the hope of an interesting window manager and I found it!

**[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)** is a dynamic tiling window manager that doesn't sacrifice its looks as they say (I agree with them, It is so cool :D). The best part about it for me was the installation and configuration which I used [ML4W Dotfiles for Hyprland](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) to set up one of the coolest-looking window managers ever if you are looking for an amazing window manager I recommend you to check out Hyprland.
