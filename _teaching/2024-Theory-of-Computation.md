I served as a Teaching Assistant for the _Theory of Computation_ course during the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters. My responsibilities included holding two weekly office hours, grading assignments, and evaluating midterm and final exams (Fall 2024 only).

In Fall 2024, I had the privilege of working under Professor Elizabeth Kleiman, whose extensive teaching experience provided me with valuable insights into both course content and instructional methods. In Spring 2025, I worked with Professor Kasturi Varadarajan, another highly experienced faculty member. Both experiences significantly enhanced my understanding of the subject and improved my teaching and academic support skills.

Throughout both semesters, we utilized Gradescope for managing and grading assignments. The platform greatly streamlined the grading process, enabling more efficient feedback for students and simplifying coordination between the teaching team.
